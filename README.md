# math_hw
Math problems and/or homework for an elementary student (**little kid**) and an advanced elementary or middle school student (**big kid**). Python code generates math problems, with user configuration of number of problems, format, and problem type. Problem types include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, and factorization. LaTex template defines the format of the output.
